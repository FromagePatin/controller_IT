% ARMv6M - DDI 0419E - ID070218 - B3.4 Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller, NVIC
ARMv6-M supports level-sensitive and pulse-sensitive, a variant of an edge sensitive, interrupt behavior. This
means that both level-sensitive and pulse-sensitive interrupts can be handled. Pulse interrupt sources must be held
long enough to be sampled reliably by the processor clock to ensure they are latched and become pending. A
subsequent pulse can add the pending state to an active interrupt, making the status of the interrupt active and
pending. However, multiple pulses that occur during the active period only register as a single event for interrupt
scheduling.
